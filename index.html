          <p>This term's terriblehack is part hackathon, part ICO! Introducing:</p>
          <h2>Terriblehack Coin (THC)</h1>

          <p>TerribleCoin is a decentralized platform and relies entirely on trust between people. The transfer of value between two parties using THC occurs based on how much TerribleCoin each party claims to have. This way we can expect zero validation time, resulting in blazing fast transactions and guaranteed zero fees for transactions.</p>

        <h3>Benefits of THC</h3>

        <p><strong>Instant Transactions:</strong> No more waiting for the payment to go through! Just trust how much money the other person is paying you.</p>

        <p><strong>Perfectly secure wallets:</strong> Your money will remain secure because you would have to agree to any decrease in your THC balance.</p>

        <p><strong>Zero Knowledge Proofs:</strong> You don't have to explain how you have this many THC or how you came up with the number.</p>

        <p><strong>Perfect Transparency:</strong> You can ask any one in the network (the world) how much money they have and they will give you the answer. Following the honor system, of course.</p>

        <p><strong>Mutable Block Chain:</strong> We are leveraging the power of collaborative editing to create the world's first blockchain so easy your grandparents can understand. Learn more below.</p>


        <h3>Decentralized Block Chain</h3>
        <p>Every transaction made with TerribleCoin can (optionally) be put into a shared Google Sheets file for everyone to verify the transaction. This is an optional step. If you choose to omit your recent transaction from the global ledger, then simply update your new balance to reflect these transactions the next time you write into the document.</p>
